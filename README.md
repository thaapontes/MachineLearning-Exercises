# MachineLearning-Exercises

This list contain some exercises using algorithms of Machine Learning, in discipline "Artificial Intelligence":

## Statements
1. Exercise 2

  -> Data in archive class02.csv
  
  -> Algorithm to be used: knn- nearest neighbors with k=10 and euclidian distance
  
  -> Cross validation k-fold with 5 folds 
  
  -> Final result: accuracy of test base
  
  
 2. Exercise 3
 
  -> Data in archive reg01.csv
  
  -> Linear Regression model: LASSO
  
  -> Leave-one-out
  
  -> Final result:  RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) for train and test base
  
 3. Exercise 4
 
  -> Data in archive reg02.csv
  
  -> Regression Tree
  
  -> Cross validation k-fold with k=5
  
  -> Final result: MAE(Mean Absolute Error) for train and test base
  
  All of the exercises were made by using scikit-learn in python.
